# CCFEBRAS-VolcanoAlgorithmAnalisys
This project is used for the needs of improvement of volcano eruption detection algorithm.

The idea:
Input consists of 2 types of images.
Ones are just images of volcano

And others are the result of olcano eruption detection algorithm where the field of eruption is supposed to be highlighted.

As we can see, sometimes algorithm work improperly causing  partial highlighting or eruption activity as on picture above.
Current version.
